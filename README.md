Description:
Chat Wrangler is a program that combines the inputs from chat and a lugged in controller.
The result is a fun and chaotic way to play games while streaming.
In my experience, as a small streamer, it leads to a game of fighting of the occasional malicious input.
But i would expect that if your stream has enough viewers the the expirience will change drastically.
And it would truly lead to an experience like herding cats.

Backstory:
This program was born from a few of my old projects i made while watching dougdoug.
I combined some twitch plays code with some code that used virtual inputs, and with code that mapped controller inputs.
But at that time it was just 3 different programs screaming at each other.
So i decided to compile a singular program to do only the chat wrangling. 


Settup:
This program is written entirely in python. so it should be very easy to get running and modify

dependencies:
pygame
vgamepad




Once you have repo downloaded and the dependencies installed.
Just run the file named ChatRangler.py in python 3.9 or higher
